### üíª Built With



[![DotNetCore][DotNetCore]][DotNetCore-url]  [![C#][c#]][Csharp-url]  
The project was developed using .NET Core and C#. During the development process, a strong foundation was established by focusing on the SOLID principles in software design and Clean Architecture principles. These principles aimed to make the code clear, understandable, and easy to maintain, while also striving to provide a sustainable and flexible code architecture. Using ASP.NET Core for RESTful API design, an interactive and reliable API was developed over the HTTP protocol.

For data access and management, Entity Framework was preferred, and NuGet packages such as AutoMapper and MediatR enhanced the modularity of the application by following patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Mediator Pattern. AutoMapper automated object mapping processes, while MediatR provided a mediator structure to handle events and requests. Blazor was employed for the UI layer, developing the web application's UI layer and enabling the use of C# code on the browser side, ensuring a consistent language on both the server and client sides.

The integration of RedisCache was added to the project, resulting in faster operations and an enhanced user experience. Additionally, with Localization support, users can utilize the application in their preferred language. These enhancements elevated the project's performance, providing a user-friendly experience and raising the overall quality of the project.

The development took place in the Visual Studio environment and was managed through GitHub. Trello was used for project management, facilitating the tracking of the development process, enhancing collaboration within the team, and providing an effective tool for planning, monitoring, and completing tasks. This technological infrastructure was brought together to expedite the project development process and elevate the quality of the application.
